# Analyze Issue Root Cause

## Overview

Systematically analyze bugs and issues to identify root causes using a structured, multi-perspective approach. This skill combines JIRA/Atlassian integration, Sentry error tracking, codebase investigation with Serena, and sequential thinking to produce comprehensive analysis reports.

**Output**: `[ISSUE_ID]_REPORT.md` file containing root cause analysis, affected code locations, reproduction steps, and remediation recommendations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Analyzing JIRA issues or bug reports
- Investigating Sentry errors or production incidents
- User requests "analyze this issue", "what's causing this bug", "investigate [ISSUE-ID]"
- Need systematic root cause analysis before planning a fix
- Debugging complex problems requiring multi-source investigation

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

Gather comprehensive context from all available sources:

**1. JIRA Issue Analysis** (if JIRA link/ID provided)
- Use `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` to fetch issue details
- Extract:
  - Issue summary and description
  - Reproduction steps
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details
  - Attachments and linked resources
  - Comments and discussion threads
- Check for linked issues or sub-tasks

**2. Sentry Error Investigation** (if mentioned)
- Use `mcp__sentry__search_issues` to find related errors
- Use `mcp__sentry__get_issue_details` for specific issue IDs
- Extract:
  - Stack traces and error messages
  - Breadcrumbs and context
  - Affected users and frequency
  - Error patterns and trends

**3. Additional Context**
- Read any file paths or code references provided
- Analyze error logs or screenshots
- Check Confluence documentation if referenced

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation

Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` to systematically explore multiple perspectives:

**Generate Initial Hypotheses**

Consider various possible root causes:
- Code logic errors (off-by-one, null checks, type mismatches)
- Race conditions or concurrency issues
- Resource leaks or memory problems
- Configuration issues
- Dependency version conflicts
- Environmental differences
- Data quality or edge cases
- Integration issues with external services

**Multi-Perspective Analysis**

For each hypothesis, evaluate:
- **Likelihood**: How probable given the symptoms?
- **Evidence**: What observations support or contradict this?
- **Impact**: How severe would this issue be?
- **Complexity**: How difficult to fix?

**Systematic Elimination**

Use logical reasoning to eliminate unlikely causes:
- Cross-reference with stack traces
- Check timing of deployments vs issue occurrence
- Verify affected components
- Consider scope (all users vs specific conditions)

### Phase 3: Codebase Investigation

Use Serena tools efficiently for targeted code exploration:

**1. Targeted Code Exploration**
- `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` - Understand file structure
- `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Locate specific functions/classes
- `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` - Trace execution flow
- `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` - Find error messages or patterns

**2. Execution Flow Tracing**
- Map the path from user action to error
- Identify all components in the flow
- Look for conditional branches
- Check error handling and validation logic

**3. Recent Changes Analysis** (if applicable)
- Use GitHub MCP to find recent changes
- Correlate timing with issue occurrence
- Review related code modifications

### Phase 4: Root Cause Determination

Based on systematic analysis, identify:

**1. Primary Root Cause**
- Exact location: `[file_path:line_number](file_path#Lline_number)`
- Technical mechanism explaining why it occurs
- Trigger conditions

**2. Contributing Factors**
- Secondary issues exacerbating the problem
- Missing safeguards or error handling
- Architectural weaknesses

**3. Impact Assessment**
- Affected users and use cases
- Frequency and reproducibility
- Data integrity implications
- Performance or security considerations

### Phase 5: Recommendations

Provide actionable recommendations:

**1. Immediate Actions**
- Quick fixes or workarounds
- Rollback considerations
- Monitoring or alerting to add

**2. Proper Fix**
- Detailed solution with code-level specifics
- Files and functions requiring modification
- Edge cases to handle
- Testing strategy

**3. Prevention**
- Unit tests to add (specific assertions)
- Integration tests for the flow
- Code review checklist items
- Documentation updates needed

**4. Related Areas to Review**
- Similar code patterns with same issue
- Related features sharing problematic code
- Upstream/downstream dependencies

## Report Generation

Create a comprehensive markdown report using the template in `references/report_template.md`:

### Report Structure

```markdown
# Issue Analysis: [Issue Title/ID]

## Summary
[One-paragraph executive summary]

## Context
- JIRA: [link and key details]
- Sentry: [error details if applicable]
- Additional files: [user-provided context]

## Investigation Process
[Summary of hypotheses considered and eliminated]

## Root Cause
**Location**: [file.ts:123](file.ts#L123)
**Explanation**: [Why this happens]
**Trigger**: [What causes it]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix
[Specific code changes or workarounds]

### Long-term Solution
[Architectural or design improvements]

### Testing
- [ ] Unit test: [specific test case]
- [ ] Integration test: [specific scenario]

### Related Code to Review
- [file1.ts:45](file1.ts#L45) - Similar pattern
- [file2.ts:89](file2.ts#L89) - Shared dependency
```

### File Naming Convention

Save the report as:
- `[ISSUE_ID]_REPORT.md` (e.g., `PROJ-1234_REPORT.md`)
- If no JIRA ID: `[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME]_REPORT.md` (e.g., `LOGIN_ERROR_REPORT.md`)

Save in current working directory or `docs/` folder if it exists.

## Best Practices

**Efficiency**
- Use symbolic tools to read only necessary code, not entire files
- Start with high-level overview before diving into details
- Use pattern search for quick discovery

**Thoroughness**
- Use sequential thinking to explore all angles
- Document reasoning process
- Include eliminated hypotheses (shows rigor)

**Specificity**
- Always provide exact file paths and line numbers
- Include code snippets as evidence
- Link to external resources (JIRA, Sentry)

**Actionability**
- Focus on concrete, implementable recommendations
- Provide code examples for fixes
- Suggest specific tests to add

**Documentation**
- Create detailed `*_REPORT.md` file at the end
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include clickable code location links
- Format actionable items as checklists

## Integration with Workflow

This skill is typically the first step in a larger workflow:

```
/analyze-issue [JIRA]
  → Creates: [ISSUE_ID]_REPORT.md
  → Next: /plan [REPORT]
  → Next: /execute-plan [PLAN]
  → Next: /document
```

The generated report becomes input for the `/plan` command to create an implementation plan.

## Resources

### references/

This skill includes reference materials to support the analysis process:

- `report_template.md` - Detailed template for analysis reports
- `common_bug_patterns.md` - Catalog of frequently encountered bug patterns and their characteristics

These references can be loaded into context when needed for comprehensive analysis.
