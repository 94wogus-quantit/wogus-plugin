name: execute-plan
description: Systematically execute approved implementation plans by managing task flow, tracking progress with TodoList, running tests, and ensuring all success criteria are met. Cleans up plan/report files after verification. Use this skill when you have an approved plan file (e.g., *_PLAN.md) and need to implement it step-by-step with comprehensive tracking and verification. README updates are handled by the 'document' skill.
---

# Execute Plan

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You have an approved implementation plan file (e.g., `USER_AUTH_PLAN.md`)
- User requests "execute this plan", "implement the plan", "run /execute-plan"
- Need to systematically implement multiple related tasks
- Want automatic progress tracking with TodoList
- Need to ensure all success criteria and tests are verified

**Typical Workflow Position**:
```
analyze-issue → plan-builder → **execute-plan** → document
```

## Overview

This skill executes approved implementation plans through a 7-phase systematic process:

1. **Plan Loading & Validation**: Load plan file, parse tasks, verify prerequisites
2. **TodoList Setup**: Create comprehensive TodoList from all plan tasks
3. **Task Execution**: Execute tasks sequentially, respecting dependencies
4. **Testing & Verification**: Run tests and verify success criteria
5. **Documentation**: Update code documentation and save learnings
6. **Verification & Cleanup**: Verify plan completion, clean up plan/report files
7. **Summary**: Present comprehensive execution report

**Note**: README updates are handled by the `document` skill, not this skill.

---

## Workflow: 7-Phase Execution Process

### Phase 1: Plan Loading and Validation

**Objective**: Load and understand the plan, validate prerequisites are met.

**Steps**:

1. **Load the Plan File**
   ```typescript
   // Use Read tool to load the plan
   Read(planFilePath)
   ```

2. **Parse Plan Structure**
   - Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` to understand:
     - Task breakdown and priorities (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3)
     - Dependencies between tasks
     - Success criteria for each task
     - Testing strategies
     - Risk mitigations
     - Expected tools and MCP servers

3. **Validate Prerequisites**
   - Check codebase context:
     ```typescript
     mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed()
     mcp__serena__get_current_config()
     ```
   - Verify required MCP servers are accessible
   - Confirm tools specified in plan are available
   - Check that dependencies (libraries, services) are ready

4. **Report Validation Results**
   - ✅ All prerequisites met → Proceed to Phase 2
   - ❌ Blockers found → Report issues, get user guidance

---

### Phase 2: Setup TodoList from Plan

**Objective**: Create comprehensive TodoList mirroring the entire plan.

**TodoList Structure**:
```
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {content: "[P0] Setup authentication infrastructure", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Setting up authentication infrastructure"},
    {content: "[P0] Configure OAuth2 providers (depends on setup)", status: "pending", activeForm: "Configuring OAuth2 providers"},
    {content: "[P1] Implement user session management", status: "pending", activeForm: "Implementing user session management"},
    {content: "[P1] Create login/logout endpoints", status: "pending", activeForm: "Creating login/logout endpoints"},
    {content: "[P2] Add user profile page", status: "pending", activeForm: "Adding user profile page"},
    {content: "[P3] Implement remember me feature", status: "pending", activeForm: "Implementing remember me feature"}
  ]
})
```

**TodoList Principles**:
- Include ALL tasks from the plan (no skipping)
- Order by priority: P0 → P1 → P2 → P3
- Note dependencies in task descriptions
- Start with first task as "in_progress"
- Exactly ONE task should be "in_progress" at any time

---

### Phase 3: Execute Tasks Sequentially

**Objective**: Implement each task following the plan's approach.

**For Each Task:**

#### 3A. Start Task
```typescript
// Mark current task as in_progress
TodoWrite({todos: [...previousTodos, {content: taskName, status: "in_progress"}]})

// Review task details
- Goal: What this task achieves
- Success Criteria: How to verify completion
- Dependencies: What must be done first
- Implementation Approach: Step-by-step guide
- Testing Strategy: How to test this task
```

#### 3B. Gather Context

Use appropriate tools based on task needs:

**Code Reading/Understanding**:
```typescript
// Get file overview
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview({relative_path: "src/auth/service.ts"})

// Find specific symbols
mcp__serena__find_symbol({name_path: "AuthService/login", include_body: true})

// Find references
mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols({name_path: "login", relative_path: "src/auth/service.ts"})

// Search patterns
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern({substring_pattern: "OAuth.*config"})
```

**Documentation**:
```typescript
// Get library docs
mcp__context7__resolve_library_id({libraryName: "passport"})
mcp__context7__get_library_docs({context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/jaredhanson/passport"})
```

**Project Management**:
```typescript
// Get JIRA details
mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue({cloudId, issueIdOrKey: "PROJ-123"})

// Check Sentry errors
mcp__sentry__get_issue_details({organizationSlug, issueId})
```

#### 3C. Implement Task

Follow the implementation approach defined in the plan:

**Code Editing**:
```typescript
// Replace symbol body
mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body({
  name_path: "AuthService/login",
  relative_path: "src/auth/service.ts",
  body: newImplementation
})

// Insert new code
mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol({
  name_path: "AuthService",
  relative_path: "src/auth/service.ts",
  body: newMethodCode
})

// Rename symbols
mcp__serena__rename_symbol({
  name_path: "oldName",
  relative_path: "src/auth/service.ts",
  new_name: "newName"
})
```

**Apply Risk Mitigations**:
- Refer to risk mitigation strategies in the plan
- Implement safeguards as specified
- Add error handling as noted

#### 3D. Verify Success Criteria

Check ALL success criteria for the task:

```typescript
// Use thinking tool to assess
mcp__serena__think_about_task_adherence()

// For each criterion:
- [ ] Criterion 1: [Check if met]
- [ ] Criterion 2: [Check if met]
- [ ] Criterion 3: [Check if met]
```

**Run Tests**:
```bash
# Execute test commands from task's Testing Strategy
npm test src/auth/login.test.ts
pytest tests/test_auth.py -v
```

**Verify Test Results**:
- All tests pass ✅
- No regressions introduced ✅
- Coverage meets targets ✅

#### 3E. Complete Task

```typescript
// Mark task as completed
TodoWrite({todos: [...previousTodos, {content: taskName, status: "completed"}]})

// Document deviations (if any)
"✅ Task completed: [Task Name]
 - All success criteria met
 - Tests passing: [Test results]
 - Deviations: [None / List deviations]"

// Move to next task
"🔄 Moving to next task: [Next Task Name]"
```

**Progress Reporting**:
```
📊 Progress: [X/Y tasks completed]
✅ Completed: [Recent task]
🔄 Current: [Next task description]
⏳ Next: [Following task]
🚫 Blocked: [Any blocked tasks]
```

---

### Phase 4: Handle Dependencies

**Objective**: Manage task dependencies and execution order.

**Dependency Rules**:
1. Before starting a task, verify ALL dependencies are completed
2. If dependency not met, skip to next available task
3. Track blocked tasks and revisit when unblocked
4. Follow critical path identified in plan

**Example Flow**:
```
Task A (completed) → Task B (in_progress) → Task D (pending, blocked by B)
                  ↘ Task C (pending, no deps) → Can start C in parallel
```

**Handling Blocked Tasks**:
- Mark task as "pending" (not "in_progress" if blocked)
- Document blocker reason
- Move to next unblocked task
- Return to blocked task when dependency resolves

---

### Phase 5: Testing and Verification

**Objective**: Comprehensively test all implemented functionality.

**Testing Phases**:

1. **Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests for modified modules
   npm test src/**/*.test.ts --coverage
   pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   # Test component interactions
   npm run test:integration
   pytest tests/integration/ -v
   ```

3. **Manual Tests**
   - Follow manual test cases from plan
   - Verify UI/UX behavior
   - Check error messages and edge cases

4. **Performance Tests** (if specified)
   ```bash
   npm run test:performance
   ```

5. **Security Tests** (if specified)
   ```bash
   npm run test:security
   ```

**Verification Checklist**:
```
- ✓ All tasks marked as completed in TodoList
- ✓ All success criteria met for all tasks
- ✓ Unit tests passing
- ✓ Integration tests passing
- ✓ Manual tests verified
- ✓ No regression in existing functionality
- ✓ Code follows project standards
- ✓ No console errors or warnings
- ✓ Performance acceptable
- ✓ Security checks passed (if applicable)
```

---

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates

**Objective**: Update code documentation and capture learnings.

**Note**: Project-level documentation (README, CHANGELOG) is handled by the 'document' skill.

#### 5A. Code Documentation
- Add/update inline comments
- Update function/class documentation
- Add README sections if new modules created

#### 5B. Capture Learnings

```typescript
// Save key insights to Serena memory
mcp__serena__write_memory({

`
})
```

#### 5C. Update Project Management

```typescript
// Update JIRA issue
mcp__atlassian__editJiraIssue({
  cloudId,
  issueIdOrKey: "PROJ-123",
  fields: {
    status: {name: "Done"},
    comment: "Implementation completed. All tests passing."
  }
})

// Add implementation notes
mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue({
  cloudId,
  issueIdOrKey: "PROJ-123",
  commentBody: `
## Implementation Summary
- [Summary of what was implemented]
- All success criteria met
- Tests: ✅ Passing
- Documentation: ✅ Updated
`
})
```

#### 5D. Final Review

```typescript
// Verify everything is done
mcp__serena__think_about_whether_you_are_done()
```

**Checklist**:
- All plan objectives achieved ✅
- All tasks completed ✅
- All tests passing ✅
- Documentation updated ✅
- Learnings captured ✅

### Phase 6: Verify and Cleanup Plan/Report Files

**Objective**: Verify plan completion, then clean up temporary plan and report files.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Do NOT skip this phase. Plan and report files must be cleaned up after verification.

#### 6A. Verification Process

1. **Re-read Plan File**
   ```typescript
   Read({file_path: planFilePath})
   ```

2. **Verify Plan Completion**
   For each major item in the plan:
   ```
   Plan Item: [Feature/Task from plan]
   - [ ] Implemented?
   - [ ] Tests passing?
   - [ ] Code reviewed?
   - [ ] Acceptance criteria met?
   ```

3. **Final Verification Checklist**
   ```
   - [ ] All tasks completed
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] All success criteria met
   - [ ] Code documentation updated
   - [ ] Learnings captured in Serena memory
   - [ ] JIRA issues updated (if applicable)
   - [ ] No unresolved issues remain
   ```

**Note**: README updates will be handled by the `document` skill.

#### 6B. Find Related Report Files

```typescript
// Search for analysis report files
mcp__serena__list_dir({relative_path: ".", recursive: false})
// Look for: *_REPORT.md files

// Common patterns:
// - [ISSUE_ID]_REPORT.md
// - [FEATURE]_REPORT.md
// - Files referenced in the plan's "Based On" field
```

#### 6C. Verify Report Information (If Reports Found)

```typescript
// Read report file
Read({file_path: reportFilePath})

// Verify:
- [ ] Root cause addressed in implementation
- [ ] Recommended fixes implemented
- [ ] Identified code issues resolved
- [ ] Suggested tests added
- [ ] Related areas reviewed
```

#### 6D. Delete Plan and Report Files

**Only after ALL verification passes**:

1. **Confirm with User**:
   ```
   "✅ Verification Complete

   Plan execution complete. All tasks have been implemented and verified.

   Implementation summary:
   - ✅ All tasks completed
   - ✅ All tests passing
   - ✅ Code documentation updated
   - ✅ Learnings captured

   Related analysis reports found:
   - [REPORT_FILE]: Root cause addressed, all fixes implemented ✅

   May I proceed to delete these temporary files?
   - Plan file: [PLAN_FILE]
   - Report file(s): [REPORT_FILE(s)]

   Note: README updates will be handled by the 'document' skill.

   (Type 'yes' to confirm deletion)"
   ```

2. **After User Confirmation**:
   ```bash
   # Delete plan file
   rm [PLAN_FILE]

   # Delete report files
   rm [REPORT_FILE_1] [REPORT_FILE_2]

   # Verify deletion
   ls -la [PLAN_FILE] [REPORT_FILES]
   # Should show: No such file or directory
   ```

3. **Confirm Deletion**:
   ```
   "✅ Cleanup Complete

   Deleted files:
   - ❌ [PLAN_FILE] (removed)
   - ❌ [REPORT_FILE(s)] (removed)

   All implementation details have been preserved in:
   - ✅ Source code (implementation complete)
   - ✅ Code documentation (inline comments and docs updated)
   - ✅ Serena memory (learnings captured)
   - ✅ JIRA (issue updated, if applicable)

   Run the 'document' skill to update project documentation (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
   "
   ```

**What NOT to Delete**:
- ❌ Do not delete if verification fails
- ❌ Do not delete if user doesn't confirm
- ❌ Do not delete if unresolved issues remain
- ❌ Do not delete if tests are not passing
- ❌ Do not delete reports if fixes not fully implemented

---

## Error Handling

### If a Task Fails

1. **Document the Failure**
   ```
   "❌ Task Failed: [Task Name]

   Error Details:
   - Error message: [error]
   - Context: [what was being attempted]
   - Stack trace: [if applicable]
   ```

2. **Check Rollback Procedure**
   - Refer to plan's rollback procedure (if defined)
   - Undo changes if necessary
   - Restore to known good state

3. **Mark Task as Blocked**
   ```typescript
   TodoWrite({todos: [...previousTodos, {content: taskName, status: "pending"}]})
   ```
   - Do NOT mark as "completed"
   - Document blocker reason

4. **Create Sub-tasks to Resolve**
   ```typescript
   TodoWrite({todos: [
     ...previousTodos,
     {content: "[BLOCKER] Fix [specific issue]", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Fixing blocker"},
     {content: "[RETRY] [Original Task]", status: "pending", activeForm: "Retrying original task"}
   ]})
   ```

5. **Ask for User Guidance**
   ```
   "⚠️ Blocker Encountered

   I've encountered an issue with [Task Name]:
   [Description of problem]

   Options:
   1. [Option 1 with pros/cons]
   2. [Option 2 with pros/cons]
   3. [Option 3 with pros/cons]

   Which approach would you like me to take?"
   ```

### If Plan Needs Adjustment

1. **Pause Execution**
   ```
   "⏸️ Execution Paused

   I need to adjust the plan because:
   [Reason for adjustment]"
   ```

2. **Explain the Issue**
   ```
   "Issue: [Clear description]

   Why adjustment needed:
   - [Reason 1]
   - [Reason 2]

   Current plan assumes: [assumption]
   Reality: [actual situation]"
   ```

3. **Propose Modifications**
   ```
   "Proposed plan adjustments:

   Original approach:
   [Original plan excerpt]

   Modified approach:
   [Proposed change]

   Impact:
   - Timeline: [change]
   - Dependencies: [affected tasks]
   - Risk: [new risks or mitigations]"
   ```

4. **Wait for Approval**
   - Do NOT proceed without user approval
   - Present options clearly
   - Explain trade-offs

---

## Execution Principles

1. **Follow the Plan**: Stick to defined approach unless blocked
2. **Track Everything**: Use TodoWrite after EACH task (not in batches)
3. **One Task at a Time**: Exactly ONE task "in_progress" at any moment
4. **Verify Thoroughly**: Check ALL success criteria before marking complete
5. **Communicate Issues**: Report problems immediately, don't guess solutions
6. **Document Learnings**: Use memory tools to capture insights for future
7. **Test Continuously**: Verify each task doesn't break existing functionality
8. **Update README**: Always update project documentation with changes
9. **Clean Up Files**: Always verify and delete plan/report files after execution

---

## Progress Tracking Format

**Continuous Updates** (after each task):
```
📊 Progress: [X/Y tasks completed]

✅ Completed:
- [Task 1]: [Brief result]
- [Task 2]: [Brief result]

🔄 Current: [Task being worked on]

⏳ Next: [Next task in queue]

🚫 Blocked: [Any blocked tasks]
