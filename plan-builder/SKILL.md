# Plan Builder - Iterative Plan Refinement

## Overview

Create production-ready implementation plans through systematic refinement cycles. This skill combines plan creation, critical review, and feedback application in an automated loop, continuously improving the plan until it achieves high quality standards.

**Process**: Plan → Review → Apply Feedback → Review Again → ... → Final Approved Plan

**Output**:
- `[FEATURE]_PLAN.md` - Thoroughly reviewed, production-ready implementation plan
- Intermediate review artifacts automatically cleaned up

**Key Feature**: Iterates automatically until the plan receives approval from the review process.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating implementation plans from `*_REPORT.md` analysis files
- Planning complex features or architectural changes
- Need high-confidence plans before execution
- User requests "create a plan", "plan this feature", "how should we implement this"
- Starting from JIRA requirements or GitHub issues
- Want automated quality assurance before plan execution

**vs. Simple Planning**: Use this skill when quality and thoroughness matter more than speed.

## Planning Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Plan Creation

Create a structured task plan from requirements or analysis reports.

**1. Context Gathering**

Collect all necessary context:

- **Analysis Reports** (if available):
  - Read `*_REPORT.md` files using Read tool
  - Extract root cause, affected code locations
  - Identify recommended fixes and testing requirements

- **JIRA/Atlassian**:
  - Use `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` for requirements
  - Extract acceptance criteria and constraints
  - Check linked issues and dependencies

- **GitHub Repository** (if provided):
  - Use `mcp__github__repository_info` for structure
  - Use `mcp__github__list_files` to explore codebase
  - Use `mcp__github__search_repository` for patterns
  - Review recent PRs and issues

- **Codebase** (using Serena):
  - Use `mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed`
  - Use `mcp__serena__list_memories` for project knowledge
  - Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` for affected components
  - Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` for similar code

- **Framework Documentation** (using Context7):
  - Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for best practices
  - Verify API usage and patterns

**2. Plan Structure Creation**

Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` to organize the plan.

Reference the template in `references/plan_template.md` for complete structure.

**Critical Requirements**:
- ✅ Every task MUST have Testing Strategy
- ✅ Tasks must be independently verifiable
- ✅ Clear success criteria for each task
- ✅ Explicit dependencies (or "None")

**3. Save Initial Plan**

- Save as `[FEATURE]_PLAN.md`
- Use UPPERCASE for feature name
- Examples: `USER_AUTH_PLAN.md`, `API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`

### Phase 2: Iterative Review & Refinement

Automatically enter review-refinement loop until plan meets quality standards.

**Review Loop Process:**

```
Loop until plan is approved:
  1. Review Plan (Phase 2A)
  2. Check Review Assessment (Phase 2B)
  3. If "Approve": Exit loop → Phase 3
  4. If "Needs Changes": Apply feedback (Phase 2C) → Repeat loop
```

#### Phase 2A: Critical Plan Review

Perform comprehensive plan review using `references/review_checklist.md`.

**Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` to analyze:**

**1. GitHub Repository Validation** (if applicable)
- Code style alignment
- Architecture compatibility
- Dependency conflicts
- Test coverage impact

**2. Completeness Analysis**
- Missing components or steps
- Overlooked edge cases
- Error handling
- Rollback procedures
- Data migration needs
- Backward compatibility

**3. Task Independence Review** (CRITICAL)

See `references/task_independence_guide.md` for detailed guidance.

For each task, verify:
- ✅ Can be implemented independently
- ✅ Dependencies explicit and clear
- ✅ Has isolated test scope
- ✅ Success measurable without other tasks

**4. Testing Strategy Verification** (CRITICAL)

See `references/testing_strategy_guide.md` for detailed guidance.

For each task, check:
- ✅ Testing Strategy section exists
- ✅ Test type appropriate
- ✅ Test cases specific and concrete
- ✅ Acceptance criteria measurable
- ✅ Test commands provided
- ✅ Covers happy path AND edge cases

**5. Feasibility Assessment**
- Technical viability
- Resource requirements
- Time estimates
- Required skills

**6. Risk Analysis**
- Critical risks identified
- Likelihood and impact assessed
- Mitigation strategies present

**7. Quality & Best Practices**
- Code quality standards
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Maintainability

**Review Output Structure:**

```markdown
# Plan Review: [Plan Name]

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Assessment**: Strong / Good / Needs Improvement / Major Concerns
- **Recommendation**: Approve / Approve with Changes / Major Revision Needed

## Critical Findings

### Required Changes (Must Fix) 🔴
1. [Critical issue that must be fixed]

### Suggested Improvements (Should Fix) 🟡
1. [Important improvement]

### Optional Enhancements (Nice to Have) 🟢
1. [Enhancement]

### Questions for Clarification ❓
1. [Ambiguous aspect]
```

**Save review as**: `[FEATURE]_PLAN_REVIEW.md`

#### Phase 2B: Assessment Decision

Analyze the review recommendation:

**Approval Criteria:**
- Overall Assessment: "Strong" or "Good"
- Recommendation: "Approve" or "Approve with Changes" (minor only)
- No Required Changes (🔴) remaining

**If Approved:**
- Announce: "✅ Plan has been approved by review!"
- Proceed to Phase 3 (Finalization)

**If Changes Needed:**
- Announce: "🔄 Applying review feedback (Iteration N)..."
- Proceed to Phase 2C (Apply Feedback)

#### Phase 2C: Apply Review Feedback

Systematically apply all review feedback to improve the plan.

**1. Parse Review Feedback**

Extract and categorize:
- Required Changes (Must Fix) - Priority 1
- Testing Strategy Issues - Priority 1
- Task Independence Issues - Priority 1
- Suggested Improvements - Priority 2
- Optional Enhancements - Priority 3

**2. Address Required Changes**

For each required change:
1. Locate section in plan using Read tool
2. Apply recommended change using Edit tool
3. Verify change addresses feedback
4. Ensure consistency with rest of plan

**3. Fix Testing Strategies**

For tasks missing or having inadequate testing, refer to `references/testing_strategy_guide.md` for examples and add:

- Test type (Unit/Integration/Manual/E2E)
- Specific, concrete test cases
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Runnable test commands

**4. Resolve Task Independence Issues**

Refer to `references/task_independence_guide.md` for guidance on:
- Splitting tightly coupled tasks
- Defining clear interfaces
- Extracting shared functionality
- Making tasks independently testable

**5. Apply Suggested Improvements**

Evaluate and apply improvements that add value while maintaining plan consistency.

**6. Verification After Changes**

Use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` to verify:
- [ ] All required changes applied
- [ ] All testing strategies complete
- [ ] All task independence issues resolved
- [ ] Plan structure maintained
- [ ] Dependencies still correct

**7. Update and Clean Up**

- Save updated `[FEATURE]_PLAN.md`
- Delete `[FEATURE]_PLAN_REVIEW.md` (no longer current)
- Loop back to Phase 2A for new review

### Phase 3: Finalization

When plan receives approval, finalize and clean up.

**1. Final Quality Check**

Verify approved plan meets all standards using checklist in `references/review_checklist.md`.

**2. Clean Up Review Artifacts**

```bash
# Delete any remaining review files
rm [FEATURE]_PLAN_REVIEW.md
```

**3. Final Output Summary**

```markdown
# ✅ Plan Creation Complete

## Final Plan
- **File**: [FEATURE]_PLAN.md
- **Quality**: Approved after [N] review iterations
- **Tasks**: [X] tasks across [Y] priorities

## Review Iterations
1. Initial Plan → [Issues found]
2. Iteration 1 → [Improvements made]
3. Iteration N → [Approved] ✅

## Key Improvements Made
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]

## Ready for Execution
Run: `/execute-plan [FEATURE]_PLAN.md`
```

## Best Practices

**Planning:**
- Start with comprehensive context gathering
- Use sequential thinking for organization
- Be specific about testing requirements
- Make tasks independently verifiable

**Reviewing:**
- Be thorough and critical
- Focus on Required Changes vs Nice-to-Have
- Verify every task has testing strategy
- Check task independence carefully

**Applying Feedback:**
- Address Required Changes first
- Don't skip testing strategy fixes
- Verify changes after applying
- Maintain plan consistency

**Iteration:**
- Quality over speed
- Typical plans need 1-3 iterations
- Complex plans may need 4-5 iterations
- Each iteration should show improvement

**When to Ask User:**
- Clarifying ambiguous requirements
- Choosing between valid approaches
- Confirming major architectural decisions
- Resolving conflicting constraints

## Integration with Workflow

```
1. analyze-issue [JIRA]
   └─> [ISSUE_ID]_REPORT.md

2. plan-builder [uses REPORT]
   └─> [FEATURE]_PLAN.md (approved)
   └─> Auto-iterates until high quality

3. /execute-plan [PLAN]
   └─> Implementation

4. /document
   └─> Final documentation
```

**Key Benefit**: Automatically ensures plan quality before execution.

## Common Iteration Patterns

**Iteration 1:** Missing testing strategies, vague acceptance criteria
**Iteration 2:** Task coupling, missing edge cases
**Iteration 3:** Polish, minor improvements
**Iteration 4+:** Rare, for complex edge cases
