# Plan Review Checklist

Comprehensive checklist for reviewing implementation plans. Use this to ensure thorough evaluation across all critical dimensions.

---

## Review Process

### Step 1: Initial Read-Through
- [ ] Read the entire plan from start to finish
- [ ] Understand the overall objective and context
- [ ] Note initial impressions and concerns

### Step 2: Systematic Evaluation
- [ ] Work through each section of this checklist
- [ ] Document specific issues with task/section references
- [ ] Categorize findings: Required Changes / Suggested / Optional

### Step 3: Assessment & Recommendation
- [ ] Assign overall assessment (Strong / Good / Needs Improvement / Major Concerns)
- [ ] Make recommendation (Approve / Needs Iteration)
- [ ] List all findings in priority order

---

## 1. Completeness Analysis

### Task Breakdown
- [ ] All necessary tasks are included
- [ ] No obvious steps missing from the workflow
- [ ] Tasks cover the full scope of the objective
- [ ] Both implementation and validation tasks present

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- [ ] Edge cases identified and addressed
- [ ] Error handling strategy defined
- [ ] Failure scenarios considered
- [ ] Recovery procedures included

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Scalability concerns handled
- [ ] Maintainability considerations included

### Documentation & Communication
- [ ] Documentation updates planned
- [ ] Stakeholder communication strategy defined
- [ ] User-facing changes documented

---

## 2. Task Independence & Boundaries

### Task Independence (CRITICAL)
For each task, verify:

- [ ] **Can be implemented independently**
  - No implicit dependencies on other tasks
  - External dependencies are explicit
  - Shared code is factored out or mocked

- [ ] **Has clear boundaries**
  - Input and output clearly defined
  - Responsibility scope is well-defined
  - No overlap with other tasks

- [ ] **Can be tested in isolation**
  - Tests don't require other tasks to complete
  - Test dependencies can be mocked
  - Success is verifiable independently

- [ ] **Has measurable success criteria**
  - Success can be determined without other tasks
  - Criteria are objective and testable

### Common Independence Issues

**Tight Coupling Red Flags**:
- ❌ Task description says "...and also..."  (doing too much)
- ❌ Task depends on runtime state from another task
- ❌ Tests require executing previous tasks first
- ❌ Success criteria mention other tasks

**How to Fix**:
- Split into smaller, focused tasks
- Define clear interfaces between tasks
- Extract shared logic to separate utility task
- Use dependency injection or mocks for testing

---

## 3. Testing Strategy Quality (CRITICAL)

### For Each Task

- [ ] **Testing Strategy Section Exists**
  - Every task has a "Testing Strategy" section
  - No tasks are missing this critical section

- [ ] **Test Type is Appropriate**
  - Unit tests for isolated logic
  - Integration tests for component interactions
  - E2E tests for user workflows
  - Manual tests only when automation isn't feasible

- [ ] **Test Cases are Specific**
  - Not generic (e.g., "test the feature works")
  - Concrete scenarios with Given/When/Then
  - Edge cases included
  - Error scenarios covered

- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria are Measurable**
  - Clear pass/fail conditions
  - Objective and verifiable
  - Coverage thresholds specified if applicable
  - No vague criteria (e.g., "works well")

- [ ] **Test Commands Provided**
  - Actual runnable commands
  - Correct syntax and parameters
  - Can be executed without additional setup
  - Example: `npm test src/module.test.ts` or `pytest tests/test_feature.py -v`

### Common Testing Strategy Issues

**Insufficient Examples**:
- ❌ "Test that login works"
- ✅ "Test login with valid credentials returns auth token"
- ✅ "Test login with invalid password returns 401 error"
- ✅ "Test login with non-existent user returns 404 error"

**Vague Acceptance Criteria**:
- ❌ "All tests pass"
- ✅ "All 15 unit tests pass with >80% code coverage"
- ✅ "Integration tests verify API returns 200 status"
- ✅ "E2E test completes user registration flow successfully"

**Missing Test Commands**:
- ❌ "Run the tests"
- ✅ "npm test src/auth/login.test.ts"
- ✅ "pytest tests/integration/test_api.py -v -k login"

## Review Best Practices

### Be Thorough
- Don't skim - review every task carefully
- Use the checklist systematically
- Document all findings, even minor ones

### Be Specific
- Reference exact tasks and sections
- Provide concrete examples of issues
- Suggest specific fixes, not just "improve this"

### Be Constructive
- Focus on improving the plan
- Explain why something is problematic
- Offer actionable recommendations

### Prioritize
- Distinguish must-fix from nice-to-have
- Start with critical issues (testing, independence)
- Save polish for later iterations

### Be Objective
- Base assessment on criteria, not feelings
- Use evidence from the plan
- Explain your reasoning

## Approval Criteria

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: plan-builder skill uses STRICT binary approval!

이 체크리스트는 **iterative loop** 내에서 사용됩니다.
"Approve with Changes" 같은 모호한 옵션은 없습니다.
계획이 준비되었거나(Approve), 또 다른 반복이 필요하거나(Needs Iteration) 둘 중 하나입니다.

### ✅ Approve (Ready for Execution)

**Use this ONLY when ALL of the following are true:**
- Overall Assessment: "Strong" (NOT "Good" - Good means needs more work!)
- All critical sections (1-8) score ✅ (green checkmark)
- Required Changes (🔴): **ZERO** (not "minor", not "a few" - ZERO!)
- Suggested Improvements (🟡): **ZERO or only trivial ones** (e.g., minor wording tweaks)
- No open questions remaining (❓ section empty)

**Result**: Exit the review loop → Proceed to Phase 3 (Finalization)

### 🔄 Needs Iteration (Apply Feedback and Review Again)

**Use this when ANY of the following are true:**
- Overall Assessment: "Good", "Needs Improvement", or "Major Concerns"
- Any critical section scores ⚠️ or ❌
- Required Changes (🔴): ANY (even ONE Required Change means Needs Iteration!)
- Suggested Improvements (🟡): ANY significant improvements needed
- Open questions (❓): ANY questions that need clarification

**Result**: Continue loop → Phase 2D (Apply Feedback) → Phase 2A (Review Again)

---

### ⛔ REMOVED: "Approve with Changes"

**이 옵션은 제거되었습니다.**

**이유**:
- 모호한 기준으로 인해 피드백 루프가 조기 종료되는 문제 발생
- "minor changes"의 정의가 불명확하여 일관성 없는 적용
- 변경사항이 있다면 적용하고 다시 리뷰해야 함 (루프 원칙 위반 방지)

**대체 방법**:
- 변경사항이 있으면 → "🔄 Needs Iteration" 선택
- 변경사항을 적용한 후 → 다시 리뷰 (새로운 iteration)
- ZERO 이슈가 될 때까지 반복 → 그때 "✅ Approve"

---

### Review Recommendation Format

Use this exact format in your review:

```markdown
## Executive Summary
- **Overall Assessment**: [Strong / Good / Needs Improvement / Major Concerns]
- **Recommendation**: [Approve / Needs Iteration]
- **Loop Decision**: [✅ Exit Loop / 🔄 Continue Loop]

## Summary
[Brief summary of assessment]

**If Needs Iteration:**
- 🔴 Required Changes: [count]
- 🟡 Suggested Improvements: [count]
- Total Issues: [count]
```

---

**Remember**: The goal is to ensure the plan is production-ready, not to rush to approval. The iterative loop exists to systematically eliminate ALL issues before execution.
